## Project Challenge
Our client is using a standard Google form for volunteering and donation amount list for Waipahu High School. The challenge presented is to find a different approach, a more user friendly and interactive way to log in volunteering hours and donation amount without the use of google forms and spreadsheet. In other terms, we are challenge to develop a full stack web application with a functional database that interacts with the web client using the targeted information (individual's email, name, volunteering hours, donation amount, date, etc.

## Project Proposal
Our web application is built using standard HTML, CSS, and JS. Several JS Libraries will be used such as Axios, aos, bootstrap <br>
We are also implementing PostgreSQL for the backend work : i.e store form information and donation sheets of each individual users.

## Project Plan

    - One Branch for Memeber
    - pages <html directory> | styles <css directory> | apps <js directory>
- Email client for more information
- Stretch Goals 
   - React.js Framework
   - Machine Learning (For User Recongination and tracking)
   - Mobile App (Seperate Project for that extra clout)
